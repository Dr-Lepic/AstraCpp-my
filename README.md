## üìå About the project
This library was developed for the **SPL-1** course submission.

**AstraCpp** is a linear algebra library written in C++, designed to provide essential **Linear Algebra** functionalities and operations for mathematical, engineering and scientific applications.\
 The project aims to create a minimalistic yet useful library focusing on core fundamentals of vector and matrix operations, decompositions and linear equation solvers.

## ‚ú® Features
- Basic and useful vector operations
- Basic matrix operations along with some advanced concepts like `RREF`, `Nullspace` etc
- Matrix Decompositions (LU, PLU)
- Linear Equation Solver
- And many more ...

Please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/SillyCatto/AstraCpp/wiki) page to see all the available functionalities.

## üöÄ Getting Started
A detailed guide on how to compile, setup and use the library is available on the [Getting Started](https://github.com/SillyCatto/AstraCpp/wiki/Getting-Started) page.

**Prerequisites**\
A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later. (MSVC or GNU g++ is preferred)

## üìù Documentation
The library primarily includes four classes:
- Vector
- Matrix
- Decomposer
- Solver

A detailed documentation of these classes mentioning all the available features and their example usage code snippet is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/SillyCatto/AstraCpp/wiki) page.
